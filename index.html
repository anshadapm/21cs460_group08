            <ul>
                <li><b>Motivation:</b>
                An exoplanet or extrasolar planet is any planet beyond our solar system. There are many exoplanets and there are some methods of detection such as Radial velocity, microlensing and direct imaging.
                But any of these methods can't detect exoplanets which are younger than 1000 years old. So here we are trying to create a model using mechine learning to infer the existance and masses from the gaps observed in protoplanatery disks (a rotating circumstellar disc of dense gas and dust surrounding a young newly formed star).

            <ul>
            <li><b>Plan:</b>We plan to use an indirect method to probe and detect young planets in planet forming systems.
            Near-infrared imaging with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) has provided lots of images of protoplanetary disks showing rings and distinct gaps in star systems like HL Tau. So using this data as well as other simulations already performed, we can train our model to predict existence of exoplanets. The paper we referred to took only the case of ring-planet interaction whereas a planet might not exist actually in that ring. Also that model is limited only to low mass planets. We would like to improve the training data so as to account for larger planets also.

            </h3> 
            The deep neural network implemented mainly using sequential model from 
            tensorflow keras model and has an input layer of six variables such as gap width, aspect
            ratio, viscosity, dust to gas ratio, stokes number and density profile. This is followed by 
            two hidden layers of nodes numbering 256 and 128. And gives a single node output which is 
            Planet Mass.
            
            The basic code is given as follows;

        <div>
            For this planet prediction model the activation function relu was applied and L2 
            regularisation was used and RMSprop algorithm was used as optimiser.

        We experimented on optimizer function to minimize error. Keras provides us with a range 
        of optimizers out of which we applied the optimization algorithm adam which is based on
         the SGD. Upon applying this lower training data was obtained but there was an increase
          in the cross validation error as given below:

        When SGD is used as optimizer function;

        RMSprop is the most efficient optimiser function since it have least cross validation error.

        <div>
             The primary part of the project involves the designing of a convalutional neural network(CNN) 
            for image recognition from the data which has been obtained from ALMA. For that
             we are currently trying to use the Network type RESNET50 whose structure we have
              studied. Possible use of ALEXNET if we can obtain better results. For optimizer 
              in keras we are using Adam which uses a stochastic gradient descent method. 
              We might try Adadelta if time permits.

        <h3>
            Sparse modelling
        </h3>
        <div>
            We are using sparse modelling(SpM) for reconstructing images from data 
            sets taken by ALMA, using input parameters as field of view, image pixel size and 
            regularization parameter set. Through this method we could reduce data size and increase
            efficiency. We execute 10 fold cross validation with SpM and process imaging with 
            minimum cross validation error. A flowchart of image processing with SpM is given below:

            Contribution From Papers   
        </h3>
        We could find some useful papers from which we get the following contributions:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) has enabled us to observe Protoplanetary 
                Disks (PPDs) with good resolution. But this resolution has been observed not to
                 be adequate enough. Hence before running a CNN we need to use a super-resolution
                  imaging techniques to be able to observe the disks.
            </li>
            <li>
                In one of the papers they utilised sparse modelling (SpM) to enhance the resolution 
                of the image by 30% compared to the conventional algorithm used. Since developing 
                a new super resolution algorithm is out of the scope we will try to obtain similar
                 algorithm to increase resolution so that we can run the CNN.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using SpM a resolution of 5 x 4 au was obtained using which they observed disk
                 and ring structures of the a young triple system T Tau from the ALMA archival data.
